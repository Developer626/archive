Past Tense Commands ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Including this extension adds past-tense synonyms for the standard verbs. Note that no new actions are created: these are all simply synonyms for existing commands. 
Does not affect out-of-world commands like Quit and Restore.
Also provides past-tense synonyms for the commands defined in Version 6/110706 of Extended Grammar by Aaron Reed, when used with that extension.
Note that a past tense of an understood synonym for an action is understood as the present-tense synonym, not as the root action. This allows you to split synonyms away from commands as usual. Except "ascended" and "descended", which map to directions up and down, not commands.


Example: * Egged 

	*: "Egged"

	Include Past Tense Commands by Dan Efran.

	The egg is in the hatchery.

	Test me with "took egg"
