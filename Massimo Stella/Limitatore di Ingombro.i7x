Check an actor inserting into when the second noun provides the property bulk capacity (this is the bulk test rule):   
   if the bulk of the noun is greater than the bulk capacity of the second noun then 
      say "[The noun] [is|are] troppo grande per essere contenut[genderity] [inp the second noun]." instead;
   if the bulk of the noun is greater than the free capacity of the second noun then 
      say "Non c[']Ã¨ abbastanza spazio [inp the second noun] per [the noun]." instead;
  
Check an actor taking when the actor provides the property bulk capacity 
   (this is the person bulk test rule):
   if the bulk of the noun is greater than the bulk capacity of the actor then 
      say "[The noun] [is|are] troppo pesante per te!" instead;
   if the bulk of the noun is greater than the free capacity of the actor then 
      say "Non puoi sollevare [the noun]. Non hai abbastanza forza per farlo!" instead;
 
To decide what number is the free capacity of (targetbox - a container):
  let sum be the total bulk of the things in the targetbox;
  change sum to the bulk capacity of the targetbox minus sum;
  decide on the sum.

To decide what number is the free capacity of (targetperson - a person):  
   let sum be the total bulk of the things carried by targetperson;  
   change sum to the bulk capacity of the targetperson minus sum;  
   decide on the sum.
